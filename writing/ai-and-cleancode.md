## Clean Code

Clean Code in simple terms; Code which is easy to read, understand and maintain. Which is popularized by Robert C. Martin in his [book](https://amzn.in/d/255Gkj5) "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship (Robert C. Martin Series)". You can also read a quick summary [here](https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988cf8d29).

In a nutshell, a practice which helps the team in longer run; having said that we may encounter many scenarios where we may need to trade-off between the practice and the business needs. You may write code on your own or through AI assistant clean code is essential for any application irrespective of it's domain or scale.

Clean code practice brings several benefits,

- Reduces overall time to understand the code
- Enables new members to ramp up quickly
- Ensures the consistency across the codebase
- Effective collaboration
- Helps teams to modify and maintain code effectively
- Improves testability & traceability

Apparently, business needs and stricter deadlines, teams may compromise with Clean Code. However, the habit of coming back to this practice again and again is essential for a team.

## GenAI - Coding Assistants

In the era of GenAI based coding assistants has emerged drastically in last few years - disrupting the conventional way of writing code. Software developers has started relying more and more on these tools for writing code faster and that too with best possible approach - adding much more responsibilty on the shoulders of developer to ensure that the generated code is 'generated' as per the expectations or not - subject to the volatality of the GenAI field and the [claim](https://youtu.be/7k1ehaE0bdU?t=7691) of replacing engineers (_humans_).

Things are changing and continue to change in different directions. However, one thing is clear that we will have one strong companion who can help us with great speed and flexibility - depending on the instructions (_prompts_) we extend in the first place. The game has shifted from being consistently _writing_ effective code to effectively _guiding_ to write consistent code. The former one was more fun to be honest but yet newer one is not a party pooper - even it may seem so.

There are several advantages we can definitely observe with this way of writing code - subject to context and prompts. Listing few of them for reference,

- Super fast in solving complex coding problems
- Rapid onboarding of new team member
- Automation of monotonous tasks
- Early detection of bugs in code
- Driven by data instead of intuition
- Real time code suggestions and optimizations
- Equally Support for modern and legacy systems

## Coding Assistant and Clean Code

Currently, majority of software developers are using coding assistant - but weather most of them using it effectively or not is a better question. Coding assistants are navigators and not drivers, developers should be at front seat and think of assistant as someone sitting next to you helping to drive _properly_ and moving into the right _direction_. 

Remember, the navigator may distract or show wrong direction. (_imagine your parent/spouse_ ðŸ˜…).

Coding assistant is growing much faster than expected because of the backed models and industry shift. Organisations are competing for _faster_ growth along with better quality. There are numerous coding assistants which are shaping (_changing_) the way we developers code.

Listing few popular tools are listed below,

- [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
- ~~Codeium~~ [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/)
- [Cursor](https://cursor.com/)
- [kiro](https://kiro.dev/)
- [Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/)

Some are assistants while some being editor by giving whole IDE equipped with AI features to enable strong control and enhanced capabilities. These tools are instructed by prompt while backed by data and context.

Bringing back the attention to the Clean Code; simple question could be  "_Can't all AI assistant be configured to write Clean Code?_".

- If the answer is **Yes** - "_Do we still need to worry much about Clean Code?_"
- If the answer is **No** - "_How can we ensure the assistant suggest Clean Code?_"
