<h1>Welcome! </h1>
<hr/>

<p>
Hi, I’m Akash — a software consultant with a passion for solving complex problems.
</p>

<p>
Over the years, I’ve worked on diverse software projects, learning new technologies and refining my skills along the way.
</p>

<p>
Whether architecting scalable cloud platforms, optimizing legacy systems, or advising on best-fit technologies, I am committed to driving efficiency and innovation.

<h3>Beyond Code</h3>
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me enjoying music, playing chess, or reading books. I believe the best work comes from staying curious and continuously learning.
